## Overview
I've created it so as to keeping the JS knowledge into practice because it's the way to acquire and really understand things and because I was bored and I wanted to do something, basically.

### The challenge
It consists simply of a count App aplying concepts of HTML/CSS/JS. It has a very short js code behind the scene but It was interesting to do it. Then I learned how to integrate an audio file with JS and made a design a little bit nice. I like the small and quickly projects and I'm happy with the result of this.

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Flexbox/Grid concepts
- Control version system using Git
- JavaScript vanilla
